Once upon a time, there was a woman named Linda.
When she went to work all the lights were off.
When she came home, late at night, the kitchen light was on.
She went, "Who's there?" and all that she got was a knife in her back.
When the sun began to rise, her sister came to her house.
She was met with a dead body.
